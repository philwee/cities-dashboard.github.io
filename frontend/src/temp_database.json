    "description": "CITIESair is a network of air quality sensors that monitors the concentration of particulate matter PM2.5 at NYUAD and several schools in Abu Dhabi. The air quality network at NYUAD consists of three stations: an outdoor station between the A1 and A2 buildings, two indoor stations in the Campus Center (C2), and East Dining Hall (D2), respectively. <br><br> Real-time air quality data is displayed on banners on NYUAD's Student Portal and Intranet, <a href='https://citiesair.com/'>CITIESair website</a>, <a href='https://www.iqair.com/united-arab-emirates/abu-dhabi/cities@nyuad'>IQAir website</a> (only outdoor station), as well as dedicated physical air quality screens in C2 and D2. <br><br> <small><b>Note: </b>CITIESair was originally a part of a student <a href='http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyuad/ad_mc_004/dscaspace_76b01eb87c7a80289e06bbdd3f316aa9.html'>Capstone project (NYUADAir)</a> in Spring 2021. It publicized, for the first time, air quality data around the NYUAD campus to the community. Recognizing the potential of this project, and to further raise awareness and encourage sustainable behaviors within and beyond the university community, CITIES decided to scale it up by equipping the network with higher-grade sensors and transferring technology to other schools in Abu Dhabi.</small>",

As a result, there was a significant decrease in Staff affiliated together with External and Other memberships; meanwhile, undergraduate student memberships only decreased by 14% in AY20-21 as most students were allowed to stay on-campus.<br><br>From March 2020 to June 2022, access to the Fitness Center, Women's Only-Gym, Indoor and Outdoor Tracks, and the 50m Pool required advanced booking on FABS' Capacity Management portal. Thus, those who wished to use these facilities must have a FABS membership. <br><br>AY21-22 and AY22-23 saw a remarkable rebounce in the number of memberships that exceeded pre-COVID figures across all demographic categories. Notably, the number of External and Other memberships (consisting of guests and other external communities) almost quadrupled in AY21-22, following the relaxation of most COVID restrictions for indoor places.",

The amount of food waste is measured by weighing the <i>plate-waste</i> (leftover food from the customers) with calibrated scales operated by the Dining service provider. Past data visualizations, such as the calendar-style monthly food waste counter at the entrance of D2, have brought about awareness among the community. Not being constrained by the crowded space of the Dining Hall, this visualization allows for a more detailed and nuanced break-down of the dataset into timeline, monthly, by-meal statistics.<br><br>The data provided here is the absolute amount of food waste. The number of transactions per meal or the number of customers who eat in D2 at each meal still need to be considered to shed light on the food waste variability over time. We are currently working with the service provider to get this data. In more detail, we aim to collect aggregate, anonymized numbers of transactions to calculate per-transaction waste.",

Despite undergraduates maintaining consistent yearly growths of around 10-20% since Fall 2014, the figure is projected to stabilize at around <b>2,200 undergraduate students</b>, according to the university's target <sup>[1][2]</sup>. As of Fall 2022, the figure already exceeded the 2,100 mark. <br><br>Meanwhile, with a target of <b>600 graduate students</b> <sup>[2]</sup>, the number of Master's and Global PhD students is expected to continue its growth in the near future. The first Global PhD cohort in Fall 2013 and first Master's in Fall 2020 started out small, comprising only 8 and 7 students, respectively. However, by Fall 2022, the number of Global PhD students had grown over 10-time to almost 100 students, while the number of Master's students more than doubled. A gradual expansion in the number of graduate students highlights the institution's growing academic diversity and depth.",

As a result, in recent years, Emirati citizens make up the largest group of students by nationality, reflecting the NYUAD's deepening roots in the UAE. Conversely, the absolute number of US citizen undergraduates has plateaued over the last seven years (around 170 students), resulting in a relative decline in their representation within the expanding student population.<br><br><small><i>*Due to privacy policies, detailed reports on other nationalities apart from Emirati and US citizen is not reported.<br>**The source data on undergraduate students' citizenship is reported in percentage points rounded to the nearest whole numbers.
