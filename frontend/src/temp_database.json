    "description": "CITIESair is a network of air quality sensors that monitors the concentration of particulate matter PM2.5 at NYUAD and several schools in Abu Dhabi. The air quality network at NYUAD consists of three stations: an outdoor station between the A1 and A2 buildings, two indoor stations in the Campus Center (C2), and East Dining Hall (D2), respectively. <br><br> Real-time air quality data is displayed on banners on NYUAD's Student Portal and Intranet, <a href='https://citiesair.com/'>CITIESair website</a>, <a href='https://www.iqair.com/united-arab-emirates/abu-dhabi/cities@nyuad'>IQAir website</a> (only outdoor station), as well as dedicated physical air quality screens in C2 and D2. <br><br> <small><b>Note: </b>CITIESair was originally a part of a student <a href='http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyuad/ad_mc_004/dscaspace_76b01eb87c7a80289e06bbdd3f316aa9.html'>Capstone project (NYUADAir)</a> in Spring 2021. It publicized, for the first time, air quality data around the NYUAD campus to the community. Recognizing the potential of this project, and to further raise awareness and encourage sustainable behaviors within and beyond the university community, CITIES decided to scale it up by equipping the network with higher-grade sensors and transferring technology to other schools in Abu Dhabi.</small>",

The amount of food waste is measured by weighing the <i>plate-waste</i> (leftover food from the customers) with calibrated scales operated by the Dining service provider. Past data visualizations, such as the calendar-style monthly food waste counter at the entrance of D2, have brought about awareness among the community. Not being constrained by the crowded space of the Dining Hall, this visualization allows for a more detailed and nuanced break-down of the dataset into timeline, monthly, by-meal statistics.<br><br>The data provided here is the absolute amount of food waste. The number of transactions per meal or the number of customers who eat in D2 at each meal still need to be considered to shed light on the food waste variability over time. We are currently working with the service provider to get this data. In more detail, we aim to collect aggregate, anonymized numbers of transactions to calculate per-transaction waste.",

        "subtitle": "Charting NYUAD's expansion since Fall 2010, this visualization dissects the student population by level of education: Undergraduate, Master's, and Global PhD students. Overall, the majority of NYUAD students are undergraduates, representing around <b>95%</b> of the entire student body in recent years. Despite undergraduates maintaining consistent yearly growths of around 10-20% since Fall 2014, the figure is projected to stabilize at around <b>2,200 undergraduate students</b>, according to the university's target <sup>[1][2]</sup>. As of Fall 2022, the figure already exceeded the 2,100 mark. <br><br>Meanwhile, with a target of <b>600 graduate students</b> <sup>[2]</sup>, the number of Master's and Global PhD students is expected to continue its growth in the near future. The first Global PhD cohort in Fall 2013 and first Master's in Fall 2020 started out small, comprising only 8 and 7 students, respectively. However, by Fall 2022, the number of Global PhD students had grown over 10-time to almost 100 students, while the number of Master's students more than doubled. A gradual expansion in the number of graduate students highlights the institution's growing academic diversity and depth.",
